Interested in a cost savy solution for good "sparkling"/"bubbled"/"gazeified" water (a.k.a. "soda" water) at home? Not interested in [encouraging large corporations nor questionnable business practices](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/pepsico-sodastream-israel_n_5b7c00d7e4b018b93e97aba2?ri18n=true) ? Here is a simple DIY solution using an elegant siphon bottle and a large CO2 tank, following these 3 easy steps:

## 1. Buy the parts
All parts can be easily ordered online (at least in Canada) or even bought at your local hardware store (here at Home Depot).
### 1.1 Bill of materials
Here is the bill of materials with indicative prices paid in Summer 2020:
- **Component	/ Provider	/ Unit Cost	/ Tax	/ Shipping	cost / Total cost (CAN$)**
- Lead-in Hose	/ www.homedepot.ca	/ $23.47	/ $3.52		/ $26.99
- Quick connect A /	www.homedepot.ca	/ $6.77	/ $1.02		/ $7.79
- Quick connect B	/ www.homedepot.ca	/$8.74	/ $1.31		/ $10.05
- 1/4’’ NPT	/ www.homedepot.ca	/ $5.38	/ $0.81	/ $6.19
- Valve	/ www.homedepot.ca	/$14.94	/ $2.24	/ $17.18					
- Alumnium Tank 5 lb	/ www.ontariobeerkegs.com	/ $89.49	/ $4.47	/ $10.65	/ $104.61
- Regulator	/ www.ontariobeerkegs.com	/$94.99	/$4.75	/$8.02	/$107.76
- Soda Siphon	/ www.icotrading.ca	/ $42.99	/ $2.70	/ $0.00	/$45.69
- Metal Charger	/ www.icotrading.ca	/ $10.99			/$10.99
					
	The total summed up to CAN$337.25, which is not cheap, but will be very quickly recovered, as explained in the ROI analysis.
### 1.2 Detailled view of parts
Pictures of all parts are available, for the [ones bought at my local Home Depot](https://github.com/jvoix/MySodaSiphon/blob/master/%E1%B8%A8ome%20Depot.png), the [ones ordered at Ontario Beer Kegs](https://github.com/jvoix/MySodaSiphon/blob/master/Ontario%20Beer%20Kegs.png) and the [ones ordered at Ipeccable Culinary Objects[ (https://github.com/jvoix/MySodaSiphon/blob/master/Impeccable%20Culinary%20Objects.png).


##	2. Assemble parts
### 2.1 Overview of assembled system
The assembled system looks like this:

### 2.2 Detailled assembly steps
* Wash all parts (excluding the regulator and CO2 tank) with hot water and soap and let them dry.
* Drill a hole through the center of the distal end of the Metal Charger and tap it with a 1/4" NPT thread, then mount the female Quick Connect using the double-sided connector (see picture of the [Quick Connect and the 1/4" NTP male connnector mounted on the Metal Charger](https://github.com/jvoix/MySodaSiphon/blob/master/Quick-connect-charger-assembly.jpg)).
* Remove the existing 1/4" male flare outlet from the Regulator and replace it with the Valve connected to the Lead-in Hose (see picture of the [regulator-valve-hose assembly](https://github.com/jvoix/MySodaSiphon/blob/master/Regulator-valve-tube-assembly.jpg))
* Mount and tighly screw together all parts using teflon tape (see picture of [all parts properly positionned before assembly](https://github.com/jvoix/MySodaSiphon/blob/master/Overview_assembly.jpg)).
